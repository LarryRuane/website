## Notes

- The _mempool_ is the list of unconfirmed (pending) transactions.
  (_Rabbit hole warning:_) More information on the mempool can be found
  [here](https://bitcoinsearch.xyz/?q=mempool)

- Initially, the mempool was stored only in memory, as its name implies.
  [PR 8448](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/8448)
  implemented persisting the mempool to disk so that its entries are
  available after a restart. This PR was merged in
  [v0.14.0](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/release-notes/release-notes-0.14.0.md#retaining-the-mempool-across-restarts).

- The `mempool.dat` file, located in the datadir, is a binary file in a
  proprietary format, making it difficult to edit it manually.

- The entire mempool is kept in-memory, it is not just a cached subset
  of a larger data structure.

- The mempool is flushed to disk when the node shuts down,
  and also when requested using the
  [`savemempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/397ed22162f05fa7fb27c2e5f49f5917884b4716/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L722)
  RPC.

- The [`-maxmempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/doc/reduce-memory.md#memory-pool)
  configuration option sets mempool size, default is 300 (MB).

- Specifying the `-blocksonly` configuration option
  [reduces](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/26471)
  the `-maxmempool` default to 5 MB.

- The [`getmempoolinfo`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/397ed22162f05fa7fb27c2e5f49f5917884b4716/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L691)
  RPC shows a summary of the local mempool.

- The [`getrawmempool`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/397ed22162f05fa7fb27c2e5f49f5917884b4716/src/rpc/mempool.cpp#L381)
   RPC displays the full contents of the local mempool.

- Another way to modify your node's mempool is using the peer-to-peer network.
  [BIP35](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0035.mediawiki)
  introduced the
  [`NetMsgType::MEMPOOL`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/2cc43de69bdb995ac7faff4ed67caf773026ab29/src/net_processing.cpp#L4602)
  P2P message, which allows a node to request the contents of a peer's mempool,
  although this message has mostly fallen out of use; there is a
  [pull request](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27426) (currently draft)
  to remove it.

- This PR adds a new RPC, `importmempool`, to add the transactions in a given `mempool.dat`
  file to the existing mempool.


## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. What are the advantages of persisting the mempool to disk?

1. Briefly, in your own words, what does this PR do, what would
   be some of its use cases, and what problems does it solve?

1. How large is the mainnet `mempool.dat` file on your system?
   Does this size differ significantly from the `-maxmempool` setting?
   If so, why?

1. What happens if the imported mempool file contains transactions that
   are already in the mempool?

1. What happens if the `-maxmempool` configuration value is too small to accommodate
   the imported file?

1. The RPC arguments include three boolean options:
     - `use_current_time`
     - `apply_fee_delta_priority`
     - `apply_unbroadcast_set`

   What does each of these do, and why they are options to this RPC?

1. The [second commit](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/fa0a6bc1a47c5a1b659bbc18c49c1f07600eeed2)
   adds the
   [`ImportMempoolOptions`](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/fa0a6bc1a47c5a1b659bbc18c49c1f07600eeed2#diff-ec4bd1642cf1575f2e44c908de766f91766c6257674f6a2d3bc02c04a0246e24R20-R22)
   struct. What is its purpose?

1. The [PR description](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/27460#issue-1666222511)
   states that it's possible to copy an existing `mempool.dat` file between two
   data directories. Does this work even if the architectures are different
   (for example, 32-bit versus 64-bit, big-endian versus little-endian)?

1. What are these
   [calls to Ensure*()](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/fab8b370257c7770abc32649ad4940eefc512f44#diff-9c5b83de6dc84af277e352c88b9291aa44340a3c75f572a0b51661eb0a838de9R753-R756)
   doing? (These occur in many RPC handlers.)

1. What does the "1" mean
   [here](https://github.com/bitcoin-core-review-club/bitcoin/commit/fab8b370257c7770abc32649ad4940eefc512f44#diff-84c7a7f36362b9724c31e5dec9879b2f81eae0d0addbc9c0933c3558c577de65R167)?
