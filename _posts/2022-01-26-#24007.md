This week, we'll look at [PR 24007](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24007)
that modifies mempool behavior to allow transaction replacement in a situation
in which it's currently disallowed.

This PR is simpler than many of the others we've reviewed, so you're encouraged
to go for a full understanding!

## Background

* The content of a transaction can be separated into two components:
  - non-witness data
  - witness data

* Since Segwit activation, there are two ways a transaction can be serialized,
  with and without the witness data.

* A transaction's `txid` is the sha256d hash of its non-witness serialization.

* A transaction's `wtxid` is the sha256d hash of its full (including its witness)
  serialization.
  (Hashing the serialization of only the witness data isn't useful.)

* It's possible for two transactions to have the same `txid` but different
  `wtxid`s. The opposite is not possible (same `wtxid`s but different `txid`s).
  That is, the mapping from `txid` to `wtxid` is one-to-many.

* As far as I'm aware, the only place any type of transaction ID appears
  on the blockchain is within transaction inputs, each of which contains,
  among other things, a
  [`COutPoint`](https://doxygen.bitcoincore.org/class_c_out_point.html).
  This object "points" to an output of the source transaction using the
  `txid` (note, not `wtxid`) of the source transaction and the index
  into its outputs array. This is the output that this input is "spending".

* Currently, when a transaction is submitted to the mempool and an
  existing mempool transaction has the same `txid`, the incoming
  transaction is immediately rejected.

* Replace-by-fee (RBF), as described in
  [BIP125](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0125.mediawiki),
  allows transactions that have already been accepted into the mempool to
  be replaced by a newly-arriving transaction. Previous to BIP125, an
  incoming transaction that spent any of the same outputs as an existing
  in-mempool transaction would be rejected as a double-spend attempt.
  This has been called the "first seen safe" policy. 

* There are several conditions that must be met for an RBF replacement
  to occur, two of which are:

  - The existing mempool transaction must have signaled willingness to
    be replaced.

  - The feerate (fee paid per virtual byte) must increase (_rough description_).

  If an RBF replacement does occur, any descendant (downstream) transactions
  in the mempool must be removed. These are transactions that (recursively)
  spend outputs of the transaction being replaced.

* The replacement transaction can spend different inputs (except at least
  one, or else it wouldn't conflict and replacement wouldn't be needed),
  can have different outputs, and therefore will always have a different
  `txid` than the transaction(s) being replaced.

* This PR implements something similar to RBF except the `txid` of the
  two transactions is the same (but the `wtxid`s are different).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR?
   [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?

1. A `wtxid` "commits to" an entire transaction, including its witness,
   while a `txid` does not. What does the phrase "commits to" mean in Bitcoin?

1. What's the fundamental difference between a transaction's non-witness
   data and its witness data? Why are these treated separately in some ways?

1. Is the mempool "indexed" by `txid` or `wtxid`? Equivalently, we can
   ask: Can the mempool contain multiple transactions with the same `txid`
   (but different `wtxid`s)? If not, would it make sense for it to do so?

1. Does this PR change a consensus rule? Why or why not? What happens
   if some nodes are running this PR and their peers are not?

1. Should Bitcoin Core policies be miner-incentive compatible?

1. When an RBF replacement occurs, why is it necessary to remove the
   descendant transactions?

1. When a witness-replacement occurs, is it necessary to remove the
   descendant transactions? Why or why not?

1. This PR allows replacement even if the existing transaction hasn't
   signaled replaceability. Is this an oversight?

1. Why would a witness-replacement transaction be broadcast? Why not
   broadcast the replacement transaction initially? What's this PR's
   use case? (Note, I don't know the answer myself!)

1. How can a transaction have multiple possible witness data that are
   different sizes? (Hint: see the
   [test!](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24007/commits/b15079ac7bc539df9854069b834f9ca437e79b8e#diff-bfc6ef96f9f5a9f10cabf5c2c18e832191e3f556f6fab0be240df109865216d8R51))

1. The PR
   [requires](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/24007/files#diff-97c3a52bc5fad452d82670a7fd291800bae20c7bc35bb82686c2c0a4ea7b5b98R928)
   the replacement transaction's size to be 95% or less than the
   size of the replaced transaction. Why?

1. (C++ question) Why is this check written as (simplified)
   `new_size * 100 >= old_size * 95`
   rather than the more obvious
   `new_size >= old_size * 0.95 `?

1. (Extra credit) How does witness-replacement interact with packages?

1. (Watercooler discussion) I've heard there have been recent proposals
   to eliminate RBF signaling. Does anyone have information on that?
   What would be the motivation to do this?
