## Notes

- This PR is a follow-on to [PR 25325](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25325),
  which we [reviewed](https://bitcoincore.reviews/25325) March 8 of this year.
  Please review at least the notes for that review club.

- The `-dbcache` configuration option determines the amount of memory
  ([default 450 MiB](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1ecdf6ea8fb6dc1d64f41323a1e337beb174c25b/src/txdb.h#L34))
  used for the coins cache as well as other "database" uses of memory;
  see [`CalculateCacheSizes()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/1ecdf6ea8fb6dc1d64f41323a1e337beb174c25b/src/node/caches.cpp#L12-L34).

- Using less memory than allowed decreases the coins cache _hit ratio_ (the
  fraction of lookups that find the UTXO in the cache); using more memory
  than specified risks crashing `bitcoind` on memory-restricted systems.

- For this reason, it's important to keep an accurate accounting of the amount
  of memory used by the cache. It doesn't have to be perfect but should be
  fairly close.

- When a program requests X bytes of dynamic memory from the C++ runtime
  library, internally it allocates slightly more for the memory allocator's
  metadata (overhead). In other words, logical memory is not the same
  as physical memory.

- This memory allocator metadata is somewhat complex and depends on several
  factors, such as the machine architecture and the
  [memory model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_address#Memory_models).

- When sizing the cache, we want to calculate physical memory usage, that is,
  account for this extra allocation metadata. Unfortunately, there's no
  library function that maps logical memory size to physical size.

- To deal with that, Bitcoin Core includes a function,
  [`MallocUsage()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/681ecac5c2d462920cd32636eec15599a9bcf424/src/memusage.h#L50),
  that approximates this conversion. Its argument is an allocation size,
  and it returns the corresponding physical size.

- That source file, [memusage.h](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/681ecac5c2d462920cd32636eec15599a9bcf424/src/memusage.h),
  includes many overloads of the function `DynamicUsage()` across
  the various data types that we might be allocating somewhere
  in the system. They all make use of `MallocUsage()`.

- The pool memory resource (added by PR [#25325](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/25325)) adds a new
  [`DynamicUsage()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/681ecac5c2d462920cd32636eec15599a9bcf424/src/memusage.h#L170)
  overload (version) that computes the overall coins cache size. This allows us to stay
  within the configured cache size.

- This PR modifies how this calculation is done.

- This `DynamicUsage()` overload (for the pool memory resource) is called only from
  [`CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b3db18a0126bc4181d2a0880c27f45d203d06179/src/coins.cpp#L40).

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)? What was your review approach?

1. In the master branch (without this PR), why does the
   [`DynamicUsage()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/681ecac5c2d462920cd32636eec15599a9bcf424/src/memusage.h#L170)
   overload have so many templated arguments?
   (Hint: compare it to the overload immediately above it, on line 170.)

1. How did this `DynamicUsage()` overload work on master? What are the various
   values being added together in this PR?

1. Specifically, why is `m.bucket_count()` part of the `DynamicUsage()` calculation?
   Why isn't the memory for the bucket allocation already accounted
   for in the resource "chunks"?

1. In this PR, where is the `DynamicUsage()` calculation moved to, and why is `m.bucket_count()` no longer needed?
   What is the advantage of not referencing `m.bucket_count()`?

1. Extra credit: What is `cachedCoinsUsage` and why does
  [`CCoinsViewCache::DynamicMemoryUsage()`](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/b3db18a0126bc4181d2a0880c27f45d203d06179/src/coins.cpp#L40)
  add it to `memusage::DynamicUsage(cacheCoins()`?
