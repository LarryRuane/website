title: "Include coinbase transactions in receivedby RPCs"
pr: 14707
authors: [andrewtoth]
components: ["rpc/rest/zmq"]
host: larryruane
status: upcoming
commit: 77da829

## Background

* The wallet RPC interface contains four "receivedby" methods:

    - `getreceivedbyaddress "address" ( minconf )`
    - `getreceivedbylabel "label" ( minconf )`
    - `listreceivedbyaddress ( minconf include_empty include_watchonly "address_filter" )`
    - `listreceivedbylabel ( minconf include_empty include_watchonly )`

  The results derive from non-coinbase transaction payments to addresses known to
  the local wallet.

* The `get` variants return the sum of the payment amounts.

* The `list` variants return a JSON array of objects, either per-address or
  per-label.

* A label is a user-specified string that groups multiple addresses.

* The `minconf` argument allows the RPC to exclude recent transactions (default 1).

* The `include_empty` argument (default=`false`) reports addresses which have
  not received any payments.

* The `include_watchonly` boolean argument includes payments for which the
  wallet has only the public keys.

## This PR

* Payments from coinbase transactions are no longer excluded from the results.

* An optional `include_immature` argument is added to all of these RPCs.

    - `getreceivedbyaddress "address" ( minconf include_immature )`
    - `getreceivedbylabel "label" ( minconf include_immature )`
    - `listreceivedbyaddress ( minconf include_empty include_watchonly "address_filter" include_immature )`
    - `listreceivedbylabel ( minconf include_empty include_watchonly include_immature )`

## Questions

1. Did you review the PR? [Concept ACK, approach ACK, tested ACK, or
   NACK](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#peer-review)?
   What was your review approach?

2. What major data structures do these RPCs access? What locking is needed?

3. How do these RPCs scale or not scale ("big-O" behavior)?

4. What's the purpose of the `minconf` argument?

5. Why were coinbase payments excluded from the results in the past?

6. Why does this PR add the `include_immature` argument? What does it do?
   Why is there a concept of _immature coins_ to begin with?
   Do you agree with this argument's default being `false`?

7. This PR makes the logic that decides whether to include a transaction in
   the results more complex. Can you explain the various conditions?

8. The functional test seems to exercise all of the various conditions.
   But how can you be sure? How can you "test the test" as part of your review?

9. Are there any downsides to merging this PR?

10. This PR changes the default behavior of these RPCs in ways that may
    break existing user's tools. Is it a good idea to include a mechanism
    to revert the behavior of these PRs? Does this PR include such a
    mechanism? Is it tested? When can it be removed?
